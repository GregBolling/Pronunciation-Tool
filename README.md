# Pronunciation_Tool
The problem we hope to address with this project is the lack of tools out there for people to practice correct pronunciation of words where the software identifies what was pronounced incorrectly and repeats the word back to the user slowly and correctly. We believe that this problem will have plenty of applications, particularly in the education system for either those with speech impediments or non-native English speakers. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58569473/113532604-c4d8a780-9599-11eb-95e3-b8a3923c3d5c.png)
